DHT11 is a Digital Sensor consisting of two different sensors in a single package.
 The sensor contains an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) Temperature Sensor, a Resistive-type Humidity Sensor and 
an 8-bit Microcontroller to convert the analog signals from these sensors and produce a Digital Output.
