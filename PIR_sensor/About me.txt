PIR stands for passive infrared. This motion sensor consists of a fresnel lens, an infrared detector, and supporting detection circuitry.
 The lens on the sensor focuses any infrared radiation present around it toward the infrared detector. 
Our bodies generate infrared heat, and as a result, this heat is picked up by the motion sensor.
 The sensor outputs a 5V signal for a period of one minute as soon as it detects the presence of a person.
 It offers a tentative range of detection of about 6â€“7 meters and is highly sensitive. When the PIR motion sensor detects a person, 
it outputs a 5V signal to the Raspberry Pi through its GPIO and we define what the Raspberry Pi should do as it detects an intruder 
through the Python coding. Here we are just printing "Intruder detected".
